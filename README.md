## Datasets

### Song dataset
- **Path**: 's3://udacity-dend/song_data'

- **Description**  
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json  
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```
### Log dataset
- **Path**: 's3://udacity-dend/log_data'

- **Description**  
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings. The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json  
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Descriptions of each template

### `sql_queries.py`
SQL queries needed in this project
  1. Drop and create tables
  2. Create two staging tables
  3. Create fact and dimension tables
  4. Load the datasets into tables

### `dwh.cfg`
Informations to connect to AWS account
  1. Redshift cluster's information
  2. ARN for IAM role
  3. Path of datasets

### `create_tables.py`
Connect to the database using AWS cluster's informations and Create tables.
It also drops the tables if it exists, so I can use this function whenever I want to re-create the tables.

### `etl.py`
Copy the data into the staging tables and insert data into the fact-dimension tables.

## Steps for the project
1. Complete create statements in `sql_queries.py`(you can also complete drop statements here)
2. Create a cluster in AWS
3. Check the informations of cluster and save it into `dwh.cfg(CLUSTER)`
4. Run `create_tables.py`(If you don't complete drop statements in the first step, complete it)
5. Complete stage and insert statements
6. Run `etl.py`
7. Check the tables running SELECT statement
