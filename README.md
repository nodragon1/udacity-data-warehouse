## Datasets

### Song dataset
- **Path**: 's3://udacity-dend/song_data'

- **Description**  
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json  
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```
### Log dataset
- **Path**: 's3://udacity-dend/log_data'

- **Description**  
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings. The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json  
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

## Descriptions of each template

#### create_tables.py
Connect to the database using AWS cluster's informations and Create tables.
It also drops the tables if it exists, so I can use this function whenever I want to re-create the tables.

#### dwh.cfg
It contains cluster's informations, ARN and paths of datasets stored is S3.
These are used for connecting to the cluster, granting roles and loading data to staging tables, respectively.

#### etl.py
Copy the data into the staging tables and insert data into the fact-dimension tables.

#### sql_queries.py
All the SQL queries used in create_tables.py and etl.py are organized in this file.

## STEPS FOR COMPLETION

- Complete create statements in sql_queries.py(you can also complete  drop statements here)
- Create a cluster in AWS
- Check the informations of cluster and save it into dwh.cfg(CLUSTER)
- Run create_tables.py(if you don't complete drop statements in the first step, complete it)
- Complete stage and insert statements
- Run etl.py
- Check the tables running SELECT statement
